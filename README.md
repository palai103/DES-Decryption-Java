# DES Decryption in Java
Mid-term assignment for the Parallel Computing course at Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze. Developed together with [Federico Tammaro](https://github.com/Sfullez), uses Java to decrypt passwords using the DES function, upon a dictionary of fixed length words set to 8 and characters in the set *[a-zA-Z0-9./]*. This work is a simulation of a dictionary attack and it is intended to show the differences between a sequential and a parallel  approach. 

The arguments must be provided to run this program are:
 - The path to the folder where the results will be saved (a PNG graph and a txt file containing the numerical values)
 - The path to the dictionary file (saved as txt file)
 - The initial chunk password (v. [report](https://github.com/palai103/DES-Decryption-Java/blob/master/PC_2018_19_Mid_Term_Report.pdf))
 - The final chunk password (v. [report](https://github.com/palai103/DES-Decryption-Java/blob/master/PC_2018_19_Mid_Term_Report.pdf))

A complete report could be found [here](https://github.com/palai103/DES-Decryption-Java/blob/master/PC_2018_19_Mid_Term_Report.pdf), containing a detailed description of the solution provided and also the tests performed.
